I did not move to the United States till I was three years old. We had lived in an apartment in New York City, until the incident of 9/11. We were forced to move out since we were Middle Eastern.		</p>	</div>	<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">			<h2>Education</h2>		<p>			In the beginning my family moved a ton. I lived in four places before we settled down in Yonkers, NY. I attended Primary School at Patricia Dichiaro Elelemntary School. I then moved once more to Syracuse in 2006 and started 4th Grade at Nate Perry Elementary. From 4th Grade to 12th grade I have lived at the same address. I attended Chestnut Hill Middle School and then Liverpool High School.		</p>	</div>	<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">			<h2>More</h2>		<p>			Me and my brother would always horseplay and wrestle, and when I saw an ad about the sport of wrestling, I joined. Wrestling broke up out of my shyness shell; I could actually talk to people without being nervous. But at the end it broke me.		</p>	</div></div>    <!-- jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins) -->    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"></script>    <!-- Include all compiled plugins (below), or include individual files as needed -->    <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-Tc5IQib027qvyjSMfHjOMaLkfuWVxZxUPnCJA7l2mCWNIpG9mGCD8wGNIcPD7Txa" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>  </center></body></html>
